# Solidity Learning Journey

Welcome to my Solidity learning repository! This project serves as a hands-on tutorial and collection of smart contracts created while following the incredible lessons from Cyfrin Updraft. It's designed to be a practical guide for anyone starting with Ethereum development.

The contracts here cover core Solidity concepts, security best practices, and are structured to be deployed and tested directly in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to **Patrick Collins** and the entire **Cyfrin Updraft** team for their world-class, free blockchain education. This repository would not exist without their comprehensive and clear tutorials.

## Getting Started with Remix IDE

You can clone this entire repository directly into Remix to compile, deploy, and interact with the contracts.

**Prerequisites:**
*   A modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
*   An internet connection.

**Steps:**

1.  Navigate to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2.  On the home screen, under "Featured Plugins", click the **"Clone"** button in the "From GitHub" section.
3.  Paste the URL of this GitHub repository into the input field and click **"Clone"**.
4.  The entire project, including all contracts, will be loaded into the Remix File Explorer on the left-hand panel. You're now ready to start!

## The Contracts: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Each contract in the `contracts/` folder is designed to teach a specific concept. Navigate to the `contracts` directory in the Remix file explorer to find them.

### 1. `SimpleStorage.sol`

*   **Concept:** State Variables, Functions, Basic Data Types, Arrays, and Structs.
*   **Functioning:** This is a foundational contract that demonstrates the basics of Solidity. It allows you to store a favorite number and retrieve it. It also introduces more complex data types by letting you create a list of `People`, where each person has a `name` and a `favoriteNumber`.
*   **How to Run in Remix:**
    1.  Open the `contracts/SimpleStorage.sol` file.
    2.  Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab (the second icon on the far left).
    3.  Ensure the compiler version matches the one specified in the contract (e.g., `^0.8.20`).
    4.  Click **"Compile SimpleStorage.sol"**.
    5.  Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (the third icon).
    6.  Click the **"Deploy"** button.
    7.  Interact with the deployed contract's functions (`store`, `retrieve`, `addPerson`) at the bottom of the panel.

### 2. `StorageFactory.sol`

*   **Concept:** Contract-to-Contract Interaction, Inheritance, and the `new` keyword.
*   **Functioning:** This is a "factory" contract used to create, manage, and interact with instances of the `SimpleStorage` contract. You can deploy new `SimpleStorage` contracts from it and then use the factory to call the `store` and `retrieve` functions on any of the contracts it has created.
*   **How to Run in Remix:**
    1.  Compile `StorageFactory.sol` (this will also compile `SimpleStorage.sol` since it's imported).
    2.  Deploy `StorageFactory.sol`.
    3.  Use the `createSimpleStorageContract` function to deploy a new `SimpleStorage` instance.
    4.  Use the `sfStore` and `sfGet` functions to interact with the newly created contract through the factory.

### 3. `FundMe.sol`

*   **Concept:** `payable` functions, Chainlink Price Feeds, and secure withdrawal patterns (Checks-Effects-Interactions).
*   **Functioning:** This is a decentralized crowdfunding contract. Users can call the `fund()` function and send ETH to the contract. The contract uses a Chainlink Price Feed to ensure the value of the sent ETH is above a certain USD minimum. The owner of the contract can then withdraw the collected funds.
*   **How to Run in Remix:**
    1.  Compile `FundMe.sol`.
    2.  Before deploying, you'll need to provide the address of a Chainlink Price Feed contract for the network you're on (e.g., Sepolia testnet). You can find addresses in the Chainlink documentation. Paste this address into the `_priceFeed` field next to the "Deploy" button.
    3.  Click **"Deploy"**.
    4.  To use the `fund` function, enter an amount of ETH in the "Value" field in Remix before clicking the `fund` button.
